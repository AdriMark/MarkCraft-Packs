# MarkCraft Packs
This repo contains the files for many of my Minecraft Bedrock Addons and Resource Packs, most of which can also be found on MCPEDL and Curseforge. Some smaller packs may only be available through this page. See https://markcraft.org for more info or join my discord: https://discord.com/invite/H7M6BxQDBn  
This repo also exists for those learning Bedrock Modding and is open for those who want to know how these packs work. Feel free to make changes and edits to these packs. You may publish those changes aslong as credit is given for the original code.
